Below is our abstract:
Sign-a-Mole is a gamified learning tool designed to teach American Sign Language (ASL) through an engaging "whack-a-mole" style game. Aimed at hearing parents of deaf or hard-of-hearing children, this game addresses challenges in ASL learning by incorporating sign language recognition and time-based gameplay mechanics to increase engagement and reinforce learning. Unlike self-paced tools like PopSignAI, Sign-a-Mole introduces forced-pace and constrained tasks to enhance player focus and retention. The game features progressive difficulty, repetition, and real-time interaction to support language acquisition. Initial user testing revealed high engagement levels but also highlighted usability challenges, such as a need for better onboarding and feedback mechanisms. These insights inform future design improvements, positioning Sign-a-Mole as a scalable and enjoyable tool for ASL learning.
